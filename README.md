# Self Paced Summer

This is a repository for CS61A, CS61B and CS50x. I will be using this repository to track my progress and to keep myself accountable(what fun). Without Berkeley's ok autograder, I will be using the following to check my work:

if **name** == "**main**":
import doctest
doctest.run_docstring_examples(FUNCTION, globals())

No response, no problem.
